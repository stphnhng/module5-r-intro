# Exercise-1: practice with basic syntax

# Create a variable `hometown` that stores the city in which you were born

hometown <- "Boise"

# Assign your name to the variable `my.name`

my.name <- "Stephen"

# Assign your height (in inches) to a variable `my.height`

my.height <- 73

# Create a variable `puppies` equal to the number of puppies you'd like to have

puppies <- 100

# Create a variable `puppy.price`, which is how expensive you think a puppy is

puppy.price <- 2

# Create a variable `total.cost` that has the total cost of all of your puppies

total.cost <- puppies * puppy.price

# Create a boolean variable `too.expensive`, set to TRUE if the cost is greater than $1,000

too.expensive <- total.cost > 1000

# Create a variable `max.puppies`, which is the number of puppies you can afford for $1,000.

max.puppies <- floor(1000/puppy.price)
